# Project Proposal

Team name: Team1

Team members: Elle Miller, Andrew Hodges, Nicholas Spray

# Introduction

Our project is an educational game inspired by the classic arcade game 'Asteroids.' The game's primary objective is to help K-5 students practice and improve their math skills in an engaging way. Players will be presented with a math equation and they must shoot the asteroid containing the correct answer. 

The game will be web hosted, allowing students to play directly from a browser. To encourage engagement, we will implement a points systems where players earn rewards points for answering questions correctly. As students progress, the math problems will increase in difficulty to match their growing skill level. This blend of gameplay and learning objectives is intended to make math practice enjoyable and effective.

## Core Features
- Math Problem Gameplay: Destroy the asteroid with the correct solution to a math equation
- Points and Rewards System: Players earn points for correct answers
- Progressive Difficulty: Questions become more complex as levels advance
- Leaderboard and Scoring: Players can view scores through the host website

# Anticipated Technologies

- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Languages/Frameworks: Lua (LOVE2D framework), HTML/JavaScript
- Database: NoSQL cloud database (TBD)
- Tutorials/Documentation:

# Method/Approach

We will take an Agile approach, using five two-week sprints to structure our development process. ClickUp will be used to manage tickets and sprint tasks. Early sprints will focus on learning the necessary technologies and building a basic working prototype. Later sprints will expand features, add difficulty scaling, and polish the game.

## Roles

### Elle Miller

- Database and Backend Integration: Set up and manage the database, connect game data to the website
- Documentation and Project Management: Handle sprint planning, ClickUp ticket tracking, and progress reports
- Game Development (Shared): Assist with implementing gameplay features

### Andrew Hodges
- Game Logic Management and Development: Lead development of core gameplay (asteroid spawning, shooting, collisions, etc)
- Feature Design: Translate game design ideas into concrete features
- Game Development (Shared): Assist with implementing gameplay features

### Nicholas Spray
- Frontend Development: Build and style the web interface (leaderboard page, instructions, game hosting)
- UI/UX Design: Ensure the game and web page are intuitive and accessible for K-5 students
- Game Development (Shared): Assist with implementing gameplay features

# Estimated Timeline

- Sprint 1: Learn Lua and LOVE2D framework
- Sprint 2: Set up the web page, database, and implement basic gameplay features
- Sprint 3: Expand features, implement first playable difficulty level, and test gameplay
- Sprint 4: Add multiple difficulty levels, user point system, and advanced features
- Sprint 5: Bug fixes, polish, final feature additions, and review

# Anticipated Problems

- Learning Curve: Lua and LOVE2D may take time to learn since they are new to the team
- Integration Challenges: Ensuring the game works seamlessly with the website and database
- Difficulty Balancing: Designing math problems that are fun, educational, and appropriately challenging for K-5 students
- Time Constraints: Keeping progress aligned with sprint goals
